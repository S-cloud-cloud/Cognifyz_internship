The projects in this file are some ipynb and py files of the ML tasks that I performed as a ML intern while doing an internship under Cognifyz, 
1)task 1: Prediction model : restaurant_rating ; 2)Task 2: Cuisine_classification ; 3) Task 3: Location_based_analysis;

Some of the files of jupyter notebook in this repository due to heavy use of Vizualization tools might need to be downloaded first to view everything better,specificaly in task3 .
